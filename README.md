# Java
SOLID_Principle - 
The code contains several Java classes working together to manage employee data. It follows programming practices and design principles, including things like interface implementation, polymorphism, and adhering to principles like the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open-Closed Principle (OCP). It also uses concepts like dependency injection, and information expert principle, and maintains high cohesion and low coupling for simplicity and effectiveness.

MyHealthData - This code consists of three Java classes: MyHealthData, MyHealthDataBase, and MyHealthDataTest. These classes are designed to manage and display patient health data, including calculating age, BMI (Body Mass Index), maximum heart rate, and target heart rate range. the MyHealthDataTest class provides a user interface to input patient data and display calculated health metrics. It allows users to enter patient data and obtain health-related information based on that data, such as age, BMI, and target heart rate range

Exception_Handling - This code comprises two Java classes: Calculator and CalculatorEngine, which together create a basic calculator program with exception handling for arithmetic operations. This code implements a basic command-line calculator program that allows users to input mathematical equations and perform calculations while handling various exceptions. 
<br><br>
Linked_List - This code defines a Java program that performs various operations on linked lists representing courses. The program is designed to showcase and demonstrate the use of appropriate and suitable methods for tasks like adding elements, converting to uppercase, deleting elements, reversing the list, sorting, and removing duplicates.

MetalRod - The purpose of this code is to create a program that allows the user to input lengths of metal rods, checks if these lengths are within a specified tolerance range around a target length, and calculates and displays the percentage of rods within tolerance. It uses two classes: MetalRodTester to handle user input and interaction, and MetalRod to represent and validate the properties of metal rods.
